There are several folders in my repository:

**'Notes'**

- Class notes and other notes that I used in making the scraper; these are mostly for myself. My Flowchart is also kept in this folder (as well as down below)

**'Versions'**

- a folder holding all my previous versions. I did this because every time I push from local I backup everything.

**'environment'**

- This folder was used to host my virtual environment.
- I recommend you use this folder as well for you virtual environment.
- Also included in the repository is a .gitignore file. This file ignores the .lpvenv file generated in the 'environment' file - making 'environment' a great place to host your virtual environemnt.
- Located in this folder is also a file called 'WebScraper8.py'. This is the file that is my current version of my scraper. This is the file you should run to access my scraper.
