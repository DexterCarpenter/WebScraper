# WebScraper

### By Dexter Carpenter

This repository is being used to keep track of my webscraper versions and progress

Below are the instuctions on how to install my websraper

Here is the tutorial I followed:

There are several folders in my repository:

**'Notes'**

- Class notes and other notes that I used in making the scraper; these are mostly for myself.
- My Flowchart is also kept in this folder (as well as down below)
	- both the PNG and the XML file are kept here

**'Versions'**

- a folder holding all my previous versions. I did this because every time I push from local I backup everything.

**'environment'**

- This folder was used to host my virtual environment.
- I recommend you use this folder as well for your virtual environment.
- Located in this folder is also a file called 'WebScraper8.py'. This is the file that is my current version of my scraper. This is the file you should run to access my scraper.

**Other**
- Also included in the repository is a .gitignore file. This file ignores the .lpvenv file generated in the 'environment' file - making 'environment' a great place to host your virtual environemnt.

Here is my Flowchart: It outlines what my program does:

**Install Instructions:**

I am using Python 2.7.14

Before running, be sure you install BeautifulSoup 4 in your virtual environment:
 
	pip install BeautifulSoup4
	pip install twilio

You're all set! Happy Scraping!
